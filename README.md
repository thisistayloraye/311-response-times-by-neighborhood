# 311-response-times-by-neighborhood
As we know it, major metropolitan cities across the United States still contain incredibly high levels of racial, social, and economic segregation, even after laws were passed meant to mitigate it (ex. Fair Housing Act of 1968). Here, I decided to look at the spatial organization of New York City and the ways itâ€™s tied to characteristics like race and socioeconomic status. By exploring how neighborhoods in New York City differ in their access to resources like city services, quality education, or even hot water, I might be able to uncover the ways city government is perpetuating racial and economic inequality, not by accident but rather through a set of policy decisions.

With [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) I was able to find a dataset that collects all 311 service request records from 2010 to present: over 3 million records from all five boroughs, with complaint types ranging from noise in the park to heat or hot water repair. After exploring the data preliminarily, I was intrigued to learn more about the possible spatial variation in what types of complaints were made, how long it took the city to respond, and even what types of agencies were dispatched to address the complaint (i.e. Department of Housing vs. NYPD).

While this started out as a neighborhood research question, I quickly wanted to know how uneven access to resources spatially relates to unequal access to resources racially and economically. Through all of these thoughts, my ultimate research question began to formulate: What is the relationship between neighborhoods, racial composition of those neighborhoods, and access to city services in New York City?
